- 👋 Hi, I'm Trystan, I graduated Wayne State College in May 2022 and University of Kansas in Dec 2024 with a Masters in Mathematics.
- Currently working freelance coding and tutoring jobs.
- 👀 I’m interested in ML, cyber-security, and robotics.
- 🌱 I have research in ML techniques for automated pentesting.

### Current Projects:
* Building a generic local LLM (private)
* LLM for DMing Dungeons and Dragons (for funzies) (private)
* Educational webapp for the kids (private)
  - Includes some borrowed MIT circuit simulation code (can be found in the gcompris code)

### Previous Projects:
 * Using ML to automate pentesting over large action spaces
 * Dark Souls Boss Music:
   - Plays audio when defeating a DS boss
   - Uses Python w/ OpenCV to track boss health
   - Currently broken (like 5 years ago, have moved on since it was mostly for fun/education)
